# AI Engines Web Dashboard

Web dashboard for the AI Engines Platform (AgentOps & Sacred Codex), built with React + Vite.

## Structure

- `src/` - Dashboard UI and client logic
- `backend/` - Backend directory (not evaluated in this audit)
- `Dockerfile`, `nginx.conf` - Containerized build/serve

## Current Status

- Frontend dashboard scaffold present with Vite tooling.
- Backend presence noted, but integration not verified.
- Operational estimate: **40%** (UI scaffold, unverified data integration).

## API Endpoints

- None in this repo; backend endpoints not documented here.

## Tests

- `vitest` scripts exist, but not run in this audit.

## Future Work

- Validate dashboard data flows against the backend.
- Add API documentation and mock data.
- Expand test coverage and add CI.
