## Testing and Verification
- `test` script available in root `package.json`
- `test:watch` script available in root `package.json`
- `test:ui` script available in root `package.json`
- `test:coverage` script available in root `package.json`
- `backend` package has test scripts: `test`, `test:watch`, `test:coverage`
- Tests are listed here as available commands; rerun before release to confirm current behavior.

## Current Status
- Estimated operational coverage: **39%**
- Confidence level: **medium**

## Next Steps
- Document and stabilize the external interface (CLI, API, or protocol) with explicit examples
- Run the detected tests in CI and track flakiness, duration, and coverage
- Validate runtime claims in this README against current behavior and deployment configuration

## Source of Truth
- This README is intended to be the canonical project summary for portfolio alignment.
- If portfolio copy diverges from this file, update the portfolio entry to match current implementation reality.
