# Contributing

## Before You Start
- Review the README for project scope, setup, and current status.
- Open an issue for significant changes before implementation.

## Development Workflow
1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make small, focused changes with clear commit messages.
3. Run available tests and linters documented in the repository.
4. Open a pull request using the PR template.

## Pull Request Guidelines
- Keep PRs scoped to one logical change.
- Include a concise summary of what changed and why.
- Document test results and any known limitations.

## Code Quality
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Keep README/API docs aligned with runtime behavior.
- Never commit secrets; use example env files where applicable.
